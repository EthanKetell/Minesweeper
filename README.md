# Minesweeper
This was my final project  for AP CS in high school, thus with not quite a year of coding experience. Uses Java Swing to build the window and draw the game.

I made this project before I knew anything about best practices (or much about coding in general), so the quality is not the best. It's mostly here for posterity's sake.
